# Compare Sorts which are in the NSW HSC Software Design & Development course
Website at: https://bwattle.github.io/10-JS-Sort/ 
<p>Code to compare selection, insertion and bubble sorts.</p>
<p>Default data is text, but buttons generate random numbers.</p>
<p>A checkbox changes the sort from text order to number order.</p>
<p>This code still needs refining.</p>
<p>Statistics for "passes" are not consitent.</p>
